## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Junior Software Developer â€” curious, highly motivated, and passionate about the world of development and continuous learning. Gained hands-on experience through independent projects and teamwork during my studies. Eager to join a dynamic work environment, grow professionally, contribute my skills, and evolve as a software developer.
My life motto: "It's better to be prepared for an opportunity that never comes than to be unprepared when one does."
